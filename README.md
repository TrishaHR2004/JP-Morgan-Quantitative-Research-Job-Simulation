# Business & Financial Analytics Portfolio – End-to-End Modeling Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a complete set of real-world analytics and risk modeling projects focused on financial decision-making, forecasting, and credit risk analysis. The work simulates how businesses, energy traders, and banks use data to predict outcomes, manage risk, and support strategic decisions.

## Projects Completed

### 1. Natural Gas Price Forecasting (Task 1)
Built a time-series regression model to estimate natural gas prices for any historical or future date.

**Key Highlights:**
- Cleaned and analyzed monthly price data
- Identified seasonality and long-term trends
- Developed a reusable price estimation function

**Business Use Case:**
Supports energy traders and contract managers in forecasting future prices for storage and trading strategies.

---

### 2. Storage Contract Profitability Model (Task 2)
Designed a financial simulation model to evaluate the profit or loss of gas storage contracts.

**Key Highlights:**
- Simulated gas injection (buy) and withdrawal (sell) events
- Applied operational constraints (capacity and rate limits)
- Incorporated monthly storage holding costs
- Calculated total contract profit or loss

**Business Use Case:**
Helps commodity firms and trading desks assess the financial viability of long-term storage strategies.

### 3. Credit Risk Modeling – Probability of Default (Task 3)
Built a bank-style credit risk model to predict borrower default risk.

**Key Highlights:**
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Simulated real loan approval decisions using PD scores

**Business Use Case:**
Supports loan approval, credit screening, and portfolio risk monitoring.

---

### 4. Expected Loss & Credit Rating System (Task 4)
Developed a financial risk framework combining PD, LGD, and EAD with a FICO-based risk grading system.

**Key Highlights:**
- Implemented Expected Loss formula: EL = PD × LGD × EAD
- Designed a 5-grade credit rating system (A–E)
- Validated risk separation using default rate analysis
- Improved segmentation using quantile-based bucketing

**Business Use Case:**
Used for risk-based pricing, credit policy design, and regulatory risk reporting.
